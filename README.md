# What I Learned
This project really honed my React skills, having to juggle the pointer events, applying forces to the newspaper rigid body being thrown and throwing feedback through the on-screen power bar, 3d model animations, and sound effects.

* On-demand 3d model animations
* On-demand sound
* React Three Fiber
* Rapier physics engine
* Zustand minimal/great state management

# Credits
This project is original however I would like to thank [Bruno Simon](https://bruno-simon.com/) and his [three js journey course](https://threejs-journey.com/) for teaching the fundamentals of three js and react three fiber.

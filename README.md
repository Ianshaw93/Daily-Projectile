This game was created using the following technologies:
* react
* vite
* three js (react three fiber wrapper)
* rapier physics
* zustand state management

# What I Learned
This project really honed my React skills, having to juggle the pointer events, applying forces to the newspaper rigid body being thrown and throwing feedback through the on-screen power bar, 3d model animations, and sound effects.

* On-demand 3d model animations
* On-demand sound
* React Three Fiber
* Rapier physics engine
* Zustand minimal/great state management
